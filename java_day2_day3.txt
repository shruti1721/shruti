Access modifier - public
String- array type
Special symbol - static

Datatypes:
Java is static typed checked.

Byte -> compiler

Memory section
->head

Q.) As compared to C, and C++, execution of Java is slower. But compared to Python it is faster
But writing the code inside Python is faster

Program is a business logic. 
Program = Data + Control.
How you want to control your data. How you will use it?

JVM - it provides a Virtual Environment
->JIT(fetching, gives code to O.S)


	1. Static Property:
	○ Static method are class method.
	○ It is called by using the class name
	
    2. Non Static Property:
	○ Non-static method are object method.
	○ It is called by Object name


In Java There is no need of Method Declaration. You can start directly with Method Definition.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS OF SYSTEM CLASS
	1. Println
	2. Print
	3. Printf
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

package com.cdac.main;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); 
		int a;
		System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
		a=sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("The value entered is: "+a);
		
	}
}

CLASS
= Data + Function
= Data Member + Member functions

A blueprint that represent the real world entity

A class is representation, attributes and behavior into a single unit. That unit is called Class.
Attributes-> data member
Behaviour->member function.
Object (a) is Stored in Heap Memory.
Address-sc(call by reference)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF TODAY

Revision of JDK, JRE, JVM, Data Types
Java language Features, 
Working with Data Types: 
Structure of a Java Class, Defining Packages, 
Operators (Unary, Binary, Arithmetic, Assignment, Compound, Relational, Logical, Equality)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.W-> compare 4 numbers greater than less than (if-else). 
1st try it inside main function
2nd try out of main function



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iteration/Loops

Entry check loop
	• For loop
	
	for( start; end condition; increment)
		{
			statement
		}
	• For each method
	• For each loop
	• While loop
	
Exit check loop
	• do while loop
      -> execute once at least, then check for the condition.
	Int i=0;
	do {
		System.out.println("Shruti");
		i++;
	}
	while(i<10);


OOPS

7 elements or pillars:

Major:
	1. Abstraction
	2. Encapsulation
	3. Modularity
	4. Hierarchy
Minor:
	1. Typing
	2. Concurrency
	3. Persistence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Access Modifiers:
	1. Public
	2. Protected
	3. Private
	4. default
	

ENCAPSULATION:
	
Wrapping of the data with its get method(public method) and set method(public method). That class is known as encapsulated class and this is called Encapsulation.

Local variable-that is declared inside method
Instance variable-that is declared inside class.
Instance Method -which are defined to work on instance variable.

Class student
{
                                    Instance variable
}
Void gjhhd()
{
                                    Instance Method
}



<classname> S = New <object>()
S= reference variable->address
Object= Object variable->value

It will create object of  class student into heap memory.
JVM has all types of memory, register, heap, etc.
In heap, the data is in unorganized way.
Before creating object, create reference variable or class reference variable, not the instance variable(it is of object).


Signature=Written type + method 

Constructor:
	• Special member function of a class, no written type, purpose: giving address to the instance variable and initialization of thenm in the heap .
	• Constructor can have parameter.
	• Types:
		a. Default: Introduced by compiler.
		b. User-defined constructors: name should be same as class name.
			i. Parameterized:
			ii. Copy:
			iii. Virtual Constructor:
	
	• Irrespective of us placing constructor whenever class is called again constructor is invoked/called.

	• Constructor Overloading: when we define a constructor more than once in the same class. Complier executes. JVM only calls the function/constructor.
	
	Ø Function Overloading/Early Binding/Compile time polymorphism: when we define the function in the same class more than once, but with different parameters.(compiler decides, which function to be called)
	
	Ø Function Overriding/Late Binding/Run Time polymorphism:(JVM decides, during runtime, which function to be called)
Note:
Java program is running on JVM. It provide, screen, memory, input with socket 
Compiler creates bite code which is stored/execute in the form of stack i.e. LIFO.

Collection: Object of any type is stored in heap.

DATA ABSTRACTION:  
	○ Declaring the method with parameter in one class, defining the functionality in another class, and calling the methods in another classes.  
	○ To preserve the data/for the purpose of data privacy/data security. 

Note:
Java reflection: is a api, through which can examine run time behavior of a classes. It can call hundreds method. Just you need the name. your security is get compromised. This is created for the purpose of hacking.

Instance Block:




reference	reference
No pointer in java	
No operator overloading	


"this" Keyword: if you want to call instance method inside another instance method.
It work to call method or as a reference. 
It can work in 6 different types. 


package com.cdac.main;

public class ConsChain {
	
	
	ConsChain(){
		
		System.out.println("no param");
	}
	
	ConsChain(int x){
		
		this();
		System.out.println("one param");
	}
	
	ConsChain(int x, int y){
		
		
		this (20);
		System.out.println("two param");
	}
		

	
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		
		ConsChain c =new ConsChain(10,20);
	
	}


}


Question for Module End.: Expect the output type question.


Exception Handling: Abnormal behaviour of execution
Number format exception.
Null exception.
Shutting down
